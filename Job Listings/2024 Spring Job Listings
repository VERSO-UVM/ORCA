- Enters data into the National Zoning Atlas Editor workspace for review and joining with GIS file

Additionally, there are optional GIS duties:
- Accesses open-source zoning district geoJSONs
- Performs topology checks to find and correct invalid geometries and boundary issues (e.g., overlapping base districts, polygons drawn outside jurisdictional boundaries, gaps/slivers between base districts)
- Merges non-continuous district polygons into multi-polygons
- Georeferences an existing geoJSON against the official zoning map .pdf to ensure accuracy of district boundaries
- Manually creates zoning district files where none exist
- Updates attribute tables with required columns according to the National Zoning Atlas methodology
