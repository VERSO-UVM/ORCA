# Team Lead Onboarding

Welcome to ORCA as a team lead! We are excited to have you on board and we know that you will be a valuable contributor to our program.

As a team lead, you will be responsible for managing your team of students and ensuring that they are productive and efficient in the development of research. You will also be responsible for communicating with the project stakeholders (the VERSO Director and Project Sponsor) and ensuring that the team's needs are met through cleary writing tasks, managing meetings and coworking time that advance the project and 1:1 with team members for coaching on growth 

This onboarding document will provide you with the information you need to succeed in your role as a team lead. We will cover the important attributes of a leader, what will happen in the first four weeks as well as six activities that will help you adjust to your new role.

# Initial Onboarding Tasks

Before getting to the fun stuff, there are a few technical onboarding tasks you will need to complete.

<h3>1. Set up your GitHub profile</h3>

* If you haven't already, go ahead and create your own GitHub account with a unique username
        
* Share your username with your program director so they can officially add you to the VERSO-UVM organization! They will send you a request, and you will need to accept the request on the “Your Organizations” page

<h3>2. Complete an I-9 form</h3>

* Email UVM Human Resource Services (hrinfo@uvm.edu) to check if you already have an I-9 form on record

* If not, visit the HR office at room 228 in the Waterman Building to fill out a form (this is a super quick process), and make sure to bring an acceptable form of ID! (view them here: https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/form-i-9-acceptable-documents)

<h3>3. Set up your PeopleSoft account</h3>

* Navigate to myUVM > click on the "PeopleSoft" icon located in the top right corner

* After creating your account, link your bank account so you can get paid! (Payroll and Tax > Direct Deposit)

* This is where you will go to log your hours as you work (UVM Time Entry > Enter Time)

# Important Attributes of a Leader

Leadership is a choice about how we treat each other. We have tried to put some attributes below but it is just a starting point. We want you to feel empowered to explore what leadership mean to you, and talk to your team and others as you explore this role
* **It is okay to care:** A leader must care about their team. They listen to and understand the concerns of others and are curious, not judgmental when a member is struggling
* **We are responsible for the choices we make:** A leader is responsible for their actions and accountable for the team, don’t be afraid of it and learn from your mistakes. This is a learning environment, mistakes are good!
* **We can only work together if we all know what we need to do:** A leader is able to communicate effectively with their team members, stakeholders, and other members of the organization. This is hard, and requires practice and gathering feedback from the team on how to be better.
* **Leading from behind:** A leader empowers their team members to achieve their goals. They are able to create a positive and productive work environment where team members are willing to take initiative with challenges and make decisions without fear.
* **Proactive understanding of problems:** A leader is able to identify and solve problems effectively before they get too big. They are able to think critically and come up with creative solutions that the team can run with and provide feedback in a constructive way.
* **Decisions are important when they are important:** A leader is able to make decisions by weighing the pros and cons of different options and make the best decision for the team when the team cannot make the choice themselve. Leaders are also willing to say when they are wrong and pivot. 

# Your First Four Weeks

We have designed a set of resources that you will need to read/listen to and write a paragraph reflection to be emailed to the VERSO Director by 3pm on Friday. Additionally there are some tasks you will need to complete.

## Week 1 (Sprint 1)
* Get a copy of each team member's schedule, including if they have a job. This is important for scheduling coworking times and meetings.
After getting the schedules set up the following meetings:
* Sprint Planning (Virtual, Sponsor and you required, VERSO Director as optional) - This meeting is for putting together what work will be in the next sprint and will be held during the first week of the sprint and will be for planning the next sprint. (learn more about sprint planning here: [link](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/sprint-planning))
* Sprint Review (Virtual, Sponsor, you, the whole team required, VERSO Director as optional)  - This meeting is required for all team members for demoing the work they completed during the sprint and should be held in the last couple of days of the sprint. This should be recorded. (Learn more about sprint demos here: [link](https://resources.scrumalliance.org/Article/sprint-demo))
* Coworking Time (In Person, you and the team) - These should be 1-2 hours blocks (ideally at least two a week) where you facilitate in person working time at the Hills 129. 
* 1:1 with VERSO Director - This is a virtual weekly recurring meeting with the VERSO Director to touch base on the team progress and ensure that they can help you with any roadblocks. Reach out to help schedule this.
* Start scheduling 1:1 with your team members, try to have at least one virtual or in person meeting a sprint with each person.
* You will get invited to a virtual Leads meeting every two weeks for just the Leads to get together and connect on projects.

**This American Life - NUMMI**
Ira Glass, 
55 min 30 sec - 
Host Ira Glass introduces the story of the New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., aka NUMMI. In 1984, General Motors and Toyota opened NUMMI as a joint venture. Toyota showed GM the secrets of its production system: How it made cars of much higher quality and much lower cost than GM achieved. But today, GM cars still don't have the quality of Japanese imports. GM went bankrupt. And in 2010 NUMMI was closed, sending thousands of car workers looking for jobs. In this hour-long story, which we reported in 2010, NPR Automotive Correspondent Frank Langfitt tells the story of NUMMI and why GM—and the rest of the American car business—wasn't able to learn from it more quickly.

**Supercharge Your One-on-One Meetings** HBR IdeaCast
32 min 49 sec - 
Most good bosses know that they should schedule regular one-on-ones with each of their team members. But fewer know exactly how to manage these meetings well, in part because organizations rarely offer relevant training. Steven Rogelberg, Chancellor’s Professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, has spent years researching the best way to prepare for, structure, engage in, and follow up on one-on-ones. He says they’re a key way to boost performance, and offers tips for ensuring that we all get more out of them. Rogelberg is author of the book Glad We Met: The Art and Science of 1:1 Meetings.
