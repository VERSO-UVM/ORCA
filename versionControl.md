Version Control:

Defintion
"A version control system, or VCS, tracks the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects together. As developers make changes to the project, 
any earlier version of the project can be recovered at any time." -Github

Purpose:
The purpose of a version control system is to provide a historical log of any commits made on the code and to provide an enviroment that faciliates group collaboration

Benefits:
Detailed log of any changes made to the code including who made a change and what changes were made
Allows groups to work on the same code 
Allows revisting previous code commits 
Provides branching option, which allows for working and testing without it effect everyone else

Types of Version Control Systems:
Centralized: A central copy of the code and certain parts of the code are "checked out". Which means that certain parts of the code can only be worked on by one person at a time.

Distributed: Every person has a local copy of the code, which means that any part of the code can simultaneously worked on, git for example.
