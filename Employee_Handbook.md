## 2. ORCA Overview
The [Open Research Community Accelerator](https://verso.w3.uvm.edu/orca/) is a program run by [Vermont Research Open Source Program Office (VERSO)](https://verso.w3.uvm.edu)) at the Univerisity of Vermont. It is an initiative that aims to translate academic research into open projects with social impact using project teams. It is focused on a dynamic and passionate group of students dedicated to bridging the gap between cutting-edge university research and real-world impact. Comprising 4-5 members, each bringing their unique skills and perspectives, the team collaborates closely with professors, researchers, and community experts to support research with the potential for broader application and transforming these research findings into open source projects.

The program will provide UVM students, regardless of college or major, with innovative experiential learning opportunities to become the next generation of leaders. It will also provide faculty, graduate students and community organizations with product and development support to further the public impact of discoveries created in UVM’s research endeavors.

### e. Code of conduct and ethics policies
The Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards (“Code”) is a tool to help you comply with legal and regulatory requirements and with University policies and procedures. The Code is designed to help you make ethical choices when and if you are faced with a difficult decision or situation. Everyone is expected to adhere to the highest standards of ethical behavior and conduct themselves in a professional manner at all times. This includes honesty, integrity, respect for others, and compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
The University of Vermont is committed to continually strengthening its ethical culture. From the University’s motto of “Studiis et Rebus Honestis” (Integrity in Theoretical and Practical Pursuits) to our values stated in “Our Common Ground”, we are all expected to perform our jobs and to conduct business in an ethical and compliant manner. All University personnel have a shared responsibility to the University, to those we serve, to our community and to each other.

The full Code applies to all University of Vermont personnel. Personnel includes, but is not limited to, faculty, staff, volunteers, student employees, and individuals hired or contracted to perform a functionthat is generally associated with an employment relationship (i.e., temporary employee, student employees). This Code also applies to all those attending a UVM hosted, sponsored or internal event.

**What is Wrongdoing?**
Real or suspected violations of legal and regulatory requirements (laws, acts, statutes, regulations), policies and procedures, and/or professional standards. Fraudulent or dishonest conduct resulting in violation of law or University policy.

**Compliance Reporting System**
The University has established a robust compliance reporting system made up of several reporting mechanisms. For more information on available reporting mechanisms, review the Whistleblower Policy: Reporting, Protections, & Non-Retaliation policy.

**Non-Retaliation**
The University prohibits retaliation or retribution for a good faith report, for supporting a person who files a good faith report, or for participating in an investigation of a report. Refer to the Whistleblower

**Policy: Reporting, Protections, & Non-Retaliation**
Questions related to the daily operational interpretation of the Code or this brochure should be directed to:

Director of Compliance Services and Chief Privacy Officer**
Office of Audit, Compliance and Privacy Services
(802) 656-3086
compliance@uvm.edu

**Principles and Standards**
The intent of the code is to communicate the principles and standards that have been identified as most relevant to the University’s stated values and to the compliance program recognizing that UVM’s policies and procedures extend beyond those identified in this code.

**Creating a Respectful Campus Environment**
Under state and federal statutes, it is illegal to discriminate based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, certain Veterans, age, citizenship status and genetic information. The State of Vermont also prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation,
gender identity and related characteristics, place of birth, ancestry, veteran status, HIV status, and discrimination on the basis of age as to persons 18 and older.

**Sexual Harassment and Misconduct**
The University of Vermont, including its Schools and Colleges, seeks to maintain a safe learning, living, and working environment. To that end, all forms of Sexual Harassment and Sexual Misconduct, which includes, but is not limited to, attempted and completed acts of Sexual Assault, Relationship Violence, Gender-Based Stalking, and Sexual Exploitation, or facilitation thereof, are strictly prohibited and will not be tolerated. The University also prohibits retaliation against an individual for making a good faith report of conduct prohibited under this Policy, as well as individuals providing information, participating in the investigation of any such report, or otherwise being involved in the process of responding to, investigating, or
addressing allegations of Sexual Harassment and Misconduct. 

**Privacy and Security of Confidential Information**
At UVM, we recognize the importance of protecting the privacy and security of confidential information. Some of this information is legally protected. Some of it is sensitive and, for a variety of reasons, needs to be kept confidential. Whether it is legally required or just the right thing to do,the University takes this responsibility very seriously and demonstrates its commitment through its Information Security and Privacy Programs. Everyone has a responsibility to maintain the privacy and security of confidential or sensitive information. Protection of this information can greatly reduce the risk of the misuse of information or a breach.

**Freedom of Expression**
While our mission is dedicated to free expression and facilitation of the exchange of ideas, we need to balance that with our need to ensure that University endorsement is not improperly attributed and that University resources and facilities are used in a manner consistent with policy and campus safety.

**Conflicts of Interest and Conflicts of Commitment**
If you, or a member of your immediate family, has (or could have) a personal or financial interest that affects independent judgment as it relates to University duties OR it could result in personal gain or advancement at the expense of the University, you may have a conflict of
interest. If you engage in external activities that significantly interfere with your ability to perform your UVM duties or are reasonably expected to interfere with your ability to perform your UVM duties, you may have a conflict of commitment. In both cases, the agreement, arrangement or activity could be prohibited.

**Protecting University Assets and Appropriate Use of University Resources**
Everyone has a responsibility to make sure that University resources are not wasted or used inappropriately. Stealing, committing fraud, bribing, and providing kickbacks are all examples of inappropriate use of University resources and are all violations of the law, University policy and the Code. We must all do our part to protect University resources.

**Research**
The University of Vermont is committed to fostering an environment in which the highest ethical standards in the conduct of research are followed. The primary responsibility for maintaining such standards of honesty in the pursuit and dissemination of knowledge rests with the faculty, their collaborating staff members, and students. An individual engaged in research is prohibited from engaging in Research Misconduct.

**Creating a Safe and Healthy Campus**
A safe and healthy campus refers to both environmental safety (i.e., buildings, grounds) and personal safety. When it comes to a safe and healthy campus, we are equally responsible for how we behave as well as how we treat others. If you ever feel unsafe or if you see or hear about unsafe conditions on campus or in your workplace or on campus, let someone know. Contact anyone listed under the resources section of the Code. If you ever feel that you are in immediate danger, call 911.

### f. Drug and alcohol policies
UVM receives federal grants and is therefore required to comply with the Alcohol and Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988. This Act requires that colleges receiving federal monies provide and maintain a drug-free workplace. UVM has no intention of intruding into the private lives of its student employees; however, the university does retain the right and responsibility to expect each employee to report to work and to perform their duties in a manner that will not jeopardize the health and safety of co-workers or other students. Some of the drugs that are illegal under state or federal law include marijuana, heroin, hashish, cocaine, hallucinogens and depressants and/or stimulants when not prescribed for medical care.

Any student employee who is at the workplace under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs, or who possesses or consumes alcohol or illegal drugs on the job or in the workplace, is subject to university disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal from the University. The illegal manufacture, distribution, or sale of illegal substances on the premises is strictly prohibited and will constitute an offense warranting dismissal. Any illegal substance found shall be turned over to an appropriate law enforcement agency. 

### g. Professionalism
* Appropriate Dress and Language: Given that different environments will require different standards of dress, it is the responsibility of the supervisor to inform students what dress will be appropriate and inappropriate for their specific position.
* Attitude: While at work, you should work with a cooperative and positive attitude.
* Timeliness: It is essential that you report to work at the agreed upon time, ready to work. Notification of lateness or inability to work a scheduled shift should be given to supervisors by students at least 24 hours in advance. This allows supervisors to plan for a student’s absence. In the event of an emergency, the supervisor should be informed as soon as possible.
* Use of Work Time: Student employment at UVM is intended to allow students access to environments, projects, and tasks that will develop their professional and interpersonal skills. As such, it is not appropriate to complete school work during scheduled working hours. Supervisors
are expected to set explicit expectations on this matter.
### h. Work-Related Injuries
If a student is injured on the job, a report of the incident should be immediately filed with the supervisor or the supervisory person in charge at the time. Please contact UVM Risk Management at 802-656-3242. 

## 4. Employment Classification and Work Hours
Your employment is under the term of the UVM's Student Employment polcies as a temporary employee of VERSO, the office fascilitating the ORCA Program. 

Student employment jobs require a departmental budget to cover the wage expense. Request a payroll combo code by providing a chart string to your primary RSENR business support staff. This code will be needed when creating or updating a job on the jobs board. Note summer employment requires a separate job on the jobs board and a different combo code that is just for the summer term. Fringe benefit rate applies for the summer term.

### Social media and electronic communications policies
#### Authorized Use
Only authorized personnel designated by VERSO Director are permitted to manage official social media accounts and communication channels on behalf of the program. Social media and electronic communication channels should be used for professional purposes related to the program's activities, initiatives, and announcements.

The University has established a robust compliance reporting system made up of several reporting mechanisms. For more information on available reporting mechanisms, review the [Whistleblower Policy: Reporting, Protections, & Non-Retaliation policy](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.uvm.edu/sites/default/files/UVM-Policies/policies/whistleblower.pdf).

## 8. Health and Safety Policies
Student employees are not eligible for benefits such as sick leave, overtime, holiday pay, vacation, or a retirement plan, but they are eligible for Worker’s Compensation under provisions of Vermont law. Worker’s Compensation covers expenses for medical care and certain benefits for loss of pay resulting from injuries or disabilities incurred while on the job. Supervisors should be contacted as soon as possiblein the event of any on-the-job injuries in order to allow for completion of the necessary forms. 
We strongly encourage a healthy work-life balance by setting reasonable expectations for workload and encouraging breaks and time off when needed. Burnout can negatively impact health and productivity, so it's important to prioritize self-care. 

Your academic needs are priority, if you need to work less due to classwork or test, let your project lead know and take care of what you need to do. 

At UVM we recognize that wellbeing looks different for everyone and that mental wellbeing is about much more than access to mental health care services. While CAPS plays an important role in supporting clinical mental health, there are many other resources on campus that also support student mental health and wellbeing. We encourage you to explore the wide variety of offerings available to support you and to help you support others.

Supporting someone in crisis
When helping someone in crisis or distress it can be hard to know what level of support they need. Take time to assess the situation by asking questions. Listening non-judgmentally and staying calm can assist you in getting to the most helpful response. Sometimes it requires calling 988 or 911. Sometimes all someone needs is someone to sit with while they are upset and to validate how they are feeling.
