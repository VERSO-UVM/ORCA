# Intellectual Property Policy  

As a general rule, students own the intellectual property that they create or invent. For example, a student in her dorm room that writes a novel owns the copyright in the novel. A student who designs a new ski binding in class or on their own in their dorm room owns the intellectual property.

The main exception to this rule is when a student is paid to work on a UVM project or if a student works on a project that makes substantial use of UVM resources generally not available to students. For example, if a student is paid to work in a lab on a federally funded research project and the student becomes an inventor on a patent, the student’s interest in the patent is assigned to UVM. In cases where the student is an inventor they share in any eventual royalty stream arising for the patent. Similarly, if UVM pays a student to create code for a redesign of the UVM website, the student’s interest in the copyright is assigned to UVM.

For certain open-source projects, UVM may require that students agree to assign their contributions to the project to UVM, even though UVM does not pay the student. This condition may be necessary to allow UVM to keep the project open-source or to meet its contractual commitments to its sponsors.

In some cases, UVM will require students to execute an IP Assignment Agreement as a condition of working on a project.

This short summary is meant to assist you in understanding a student’s rights and obligations.  The [UVM IP Policy](https://www.uvm.edu/sites/default/files/UVM-Policies/policies/intellectualproperty.pdf) sets for the full and official policy of UVM   If you have any questions relating to how this policy works, please feel free to reach out to Andrew.zehner@uvm.edu. 

## Additional Details

Undergraduate, Graduate, Medical and Visiting Students, full-time and part-time (“University Students”) University Students are considered “Covered Persons” under this Policy for purposes of disposition of Intellectual Property developed by them as further described under this Policy. All Intellectual Property developed by University Students participating in University activities shall belong either to the University or to the Student, according to this Policy. When serving in the capacity of a University employee (e.g. students working part-time for the University), University students shall ordinarily be deemed staff employees covered under §2.2.1 of this Policy.  

All University faculty and staff, University Visitors and University Students who engage in activities that will or may result in University ownership of Intellectual Property in accordance with this Policy must, prior to participating in any such activity, execute the University’s Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement (“IPAA”), attached hereto as Appendix A. Execution of the IPAA is deemed a condition to participation in any such University activities. If the IPAA is not executed as required under this §3.1, such individual is nevertheless subject to this Policy as a condition of his or her participation. The University and all necessary parties must approve the use of any documents relating to ownership of intellectual property other than the IPAA 

Student Academic Work It is the general policy of the University that University Students shall have ownership rights in Intellectual Property developed by them independently or as a part of their coursework, except where it is developed using University funds, or where the University student has a formal employment relationship with the University, or where the University has external obligations with respect to Student Intellectual Property. In such cases, Student Intellectual Property is hereby assigned to the University pursuant to §§ 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 of this Policy. The waiver provisions of §3.3.2 shall apply to University Students. Activities undertaken by University Students receiving financial aid as tuition assistance shall not be considered “University funds” unless such assistance consists of employment at the University (including, but not limited to teaching assistantships) or is charged against a grant, contract or other agreement between the University and an external funding source. 3.
