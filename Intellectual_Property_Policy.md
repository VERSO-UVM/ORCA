# Intellectual Property Policy  
Last Updated 2/29/2024

As a general rule, students own the intellectual property that they create or invent. For example, a student in her dorm room that writes a novel owns the copyright in the novel. A student that designs a new device (without the substantial use of UVM resources) owns the intellectual property in the device.

The main exception to this rule is when a student is paid to work on a UVM project or if a student works on a project that makes substantial use of UVM resources. For example, if a student is paid to work in a lab on a federally funded research project and the student becomes an inventor on a patent, the student’s interest in the patent is assigned to UVM. Similarly, if UVM pays a student to create code for a redesign of the UVM website, the student’s interest in the copyright is assigned to UVM.

For certain open-source projects, UVM may require that students agree to assign their contributions to the project to UVM, even though UVM does not pay the student. This condition may be necessary to allow UVM to keep the project open-source or to meet its contractual commitments to its sponsors.

In some cases, UVM will require students to execute an IP Assignment Agreement as a condition of working on a project.

This short summary is meant to assist you in understanding a student’s rights and obligations.
