## Summary
ORCA's goals are to (1) produce impactful, accessible open source research tools by (2) training tomorrow's workforce in marketable open source skills. This page describes how we at ORCA achieve these two goals. In short, by drawing on the latest research on openness, we work with stakeholders to design research products that are open to more people from more backgrounds while creating environments in which students are more likely to learn valued workplace skills.

## How We Make Research Open
- Need research to be more open
  - Funders are concerned that research isn't getting into the hands of those who could benefit from it
  - Through experience, this is often because research artifacts aren't designed with accessibility in mind so much as publication and licensing
  - This is a problem because it wastes taxpayer dollars, leaves new solutions unimplemented, and many issues unaddressed altogether
  - Consequently, there's a need for research greater research "translation"
- VERSO addresses this by making research with high impact potential more accessible from the start


## How We Train Students In and Through Openness
ORCA internships create learning environments that provide every student with the best opportunities to construct their own knowledge and acquire practical skills relevant to their interests. It achieves these outcomes by incorporating research-based principles of learning (e.g. forming connections through practical examples, fostering feelings of belonging) that create inclusive climates for students of diverse backgrounds and through frequent, immediate, clear, and kind feedback. 

### Course learning objectives/outcomes
This internship will advance students toward being able to do the following:
- Collaborate with other professionals to address customer and stakeholder needs.
- Execute industry-standard Agile software development activities.
- Communicate the professional activities you know how to perform.

### Use of required platforms and software:
GitHub will be used as a code repo, project management tool and knowledge repository for both the specific project and overall ORCA Program. MS Teams will be used as the virtual meeting software and Sprint Review will be recorded. The ORCA Slack will be used for team communication and document storage

## Who We Are
ORCA's daily operations are run by Kendall Fortney, Director of VERSO, an experienced industry designer and program manager. Kendall receives strategy and community assistance from John Meluso, VERSO Postdoctoral Fellow, an expert in management and organizing in open ecosystems. Kendall and John design and operate ORCA with consultation from an advisory committee of teaching and research professors across the fields of computer science and business.
