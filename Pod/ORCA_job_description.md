###  Job description
Open Research Community Accelerator is a new initiative that aims to translate academic research into open projects with social impact using project teams while providing experiential learning in real work environments about development, research and open source practices.

The team will collaborate closely with professors, researchers, and community experts to identify research with the potential for broader application and transform these research findings into open projects.

ORCA also offers faculty, graduate students and community organizations with product and development support to enhance the public value of their research and address collective community needs. The program operates under the supervision of the Director of VERSO, who also provides mentorship and guidance to the students.

The program will provide UVM students, regardless of college or major, with innovative experiential learning opportunities to become the next generation of leaders. 

### Course learning objectives/outcomes
This internship will advance students toward being able to do the following:
Collaborate with other professionals to address customer and stakeholder needs.
Execute industry-standard Agile software development activities.
Communicate the professional activities you know how to perform.

## Pedagogy
This internship strives to create learning environments that provide every student with the best opportunities to construct their own knowledge and acquire practical skills relevant to their interests. It will achieve these outcomes by incorporating research-based principles of learning (e.g. forming connections through practical examples, fostering feelings of belonging) that create inclusive climates for students of diverse backgrounds and through frequent, immediate, clear, and kind feedback.
### Required internship materials:
- There are no books that are required for participating in ORCA although a reading list of books available at the UVM Library may be provided if students are interested
- Online Article Links will be provided through the different sections in the ORCA GitHub
- If there are any shared video, it will be on a free platform for viewing (like YouTube)
- The only software required will be MS Teams and Slack, otherwise the students can determine additional software needs on a project to project basis. 
### Required platforms and software: 
At this time:
- GitHub
- MS Teams
- Slack
- Student chosen IDE
### Use of required platforms and software:
GitHub will be used as a code repo, project management tool and knowledge repository for both the specific project and overall ORCA Program. MS Teams will be used as the virtual meeting software and Sprint Review will be recorded. The ORCA Slack will be used for team communication and document storage.
### Attendance policy and internship environment expectations: 
In this internship, we will work together to develop a learning community that is inclusive and respectful. As a learning community we will seek to encourage and appreciate expressions of different ideas, opinions, and beliefs in the spirit of Our Common Ground. Meaningful and constructive dialogue is encouraged in this internship. This requires mutual respect, willingness to listen, and open-mindedness to opposing points of view. Respect for individual differences and alternative viewpoints will be maintained at all times in this internship. Conduct that substantially or repeatedly disrupts the ability of instructors to teach and the ability of students to engage may result in my asking a student to temporarily leave the meeting. See [Undergraduate Catalogue - Classroom Code of Conduct (p. 443-444)](https://catalogue.uvm.edu/undergraduate/academicinfo/rightsandresponsibilities/)
### Assessments:
While this internship takes place in an academic setting, we will not give you grades. Our goal is to equip you to perform professional activities like professionals perform those activities, and to be able to describe and demonstrate your ability to perform those activities.
Instead, assessments in this internship will come in the form of customer-, stakeholder-, and self-feedback. How well are your products meeting their needs? How well does the team communicate with customers and stakeholders about project progress and status? And how well do you think you are doing at advancing toward your own goals?
At the beginning of each semester we will ask you to state your goals for personal growth. At the end of each semester, we will ask you to reflect and assess your own advancement toward those goals. You will be required to submit these initial and final statements to help us understand your learning journey, and to improve your own learning journey and those of your peers, now and in the future.
