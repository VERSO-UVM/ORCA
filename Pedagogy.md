## Pedagogy
This internship strives to create learning environments that provide every student with the best opportunities to construct their own knowledge and acquire practical skills relevant to their interests. It will achieve these outcomes by incorporating research-based principles of learning (e.g. forming connections through practical examples, fostering feelings of belonging) that create inclusive climates for students of diverse backgrounds and through frequent, immediate, clear, and kind feedback.
