## Governance


Open-source governance is a political philosophy that applies the principles of open-source and open-content movements to democratic principles. It enables any interested citizen to contribute to the creation of policy, as with a wiki document. The legislation is democratically opened to the general citizenry, employing their collective wisdom to benefit the decision-making process and improve democracy. There are a wide array of projects and movements which are working on building open-source governance systems. Open-source governance is not limited to politics, but it can also be applied to data governance. Open source data governance tools are software programs that help manage data assets. They provide a range of features, such as data classification, metadata management, data lineage tracking, and collaboration tools. Open source data governance tools are typically free to use and can be modified to meet specific needs.
