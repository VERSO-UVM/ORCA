## Summary
ORCA's goals are to (1) produce impactful, accessible, open source research tools by (2) training tomorrow's workforce in marketable open source skills. This page describes how we at ORCA achieve these two goals. In short, by drawing on the latest research on openness, we work with stakeholders to design research products that are open to more people from more backgrounds while creating environments in which students are more likely to learn valued workplace skills.

## What's the need?
Here at [VERSO](https://verso.w3.uvm.edu/), we focus on open source in all its incarnations. But, while some see open source as an end in and of itself, we primarily view open source as a means for addressing crucial problems related to greater [transparency](https://www.archives.gov/files/cui/documents/2009-WH-memo-on-transparency-and-open-government.pdf), [innovation](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/ostp_public_access_memo_2013.pdf), and [inclusion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/08-2022-OSTP-Public-Access-Memo.pdf).

It is in this light that funders turn to open source to address increasing concerns that research and its products aren't getting into the hands of those who need it most. For example, the US National Science Foundation created the [Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE)](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/pathways-enable-open-source-ecosystems-pose) program to "ensure broader and more diverse adoption of open-source products...and a more focused route to technologies with broad societal impact." Likewise, the Sloan Foundation's [Better Software for Science](https://sloan.org/programs/digital-technology/better-software-for-science) program funds open source because "academia often fails to leverage best practices for software engineering from industry or...to realize the full potential of software in advancing discovery."

Underlying these programs is a desire for greater [research translation](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/accelerating-research-translation-art) -- that is, making research sufficiently accessible and applicable to other contexts that people in other fields, companies, governments, etc. can effectively implement, mature, and scale up those research advances. Research often does not get translated into other fields or into practice for [several reasons](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/accelerating-research-translation-art/nsf23-558/solicitation#pgm_intr_txt): a university may lack financial resources, lack local innovation ecosystems, or may incentivize fundamental (i.e. theoretical) research significantly more than applied research. Insufficient translation means that taxpayer funds often do not benefit taxpayers, feasible solutions don't get implemented in practice, and important issues go unexplored altogether. Consequently, significant need exists for greater research translation and the knowledge of how to translate research.

This lack of translation intersects with something else we seen in industry and academia: students often emerge from college without needed ("real") workplace skills. Insufficient programming skills manifest as [shortages of programmers](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/09/21/1079695/new-approaches-to-the-tech-talent-shortage/) which, in turn, makes it harder for companies to adopt the latest technologies. On the other hand, [engineering graduates often lack "professional skills,"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2005.tb00828.x) like communication and teamwork skills. This has been so much the case that it eventually motivated the engineering accreditation body ABET to require universities to teach engineering students these skill in order to receive accreditation. Governments are concerned here, too, with even [militaries providing significant funding for education](https://www.grants.gov/search-results-detail/351854) and outreach activities.

This isn't a new phenomenon, though; for centuries (literally), students have learned how to become valued contributors to an occupation [on the job](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Situated_Learning/CAVIOrW3vYAC) rather than in school. Indeed, [this still happens today in open source software](https://doi.org/10.2753/MIS0742-1222250401). This and other examples have led engineering educators and others to turn to [project-based learning](https://knilt.arcc.albany.edu/images/4/4d/PBL_Article.pdf) in which students kinda-sorta "learn on the job" while being in the classroom. Often, these students work on real projects under the tutelage of instructors, mentors, and even [recent students](doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2020.14214). Indeed, a growing body of work demonstrates that giving students legitimate (i.e. _real_) tasks to work on, ones that affect other people and that could actually go into practice, can spur student learning toward becoming valued members of an occupation and is often more mearningful for students. While not the only way to learn, researchers generally agree that [students need work grounded in reality](doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2020.14214) to learn an occupation. So is there a way we can train students in what they'll _need_ to do in the workforce -- legitimate work, work that makes an impact -- while they're still in school?

Good news! _Work that makes an impact_ sounds a lot like translation work, doesn't it?

## We translate scholarship by "opening up" research
ORCA addresses the need for research translation by intentionally shepherding projects with high-impact potential toward greater accessibility through open source practices.

That was a mouthful, wasn't it? Let's take things one at a time.

ORCA works with researchers and local businesses to identify projects with "high-impact potential." Not all research can or should be applicable to other contexts immediately. Fundamental research has great benefits (and is pretty fun, too). Nor does all research have potential to significantly impact other fields. But when research is ready -- when we have evidence that an artifact is sufficiently advanced that other fields of science or industrial applications might benefit from it -- then we jump. A great example is the [Interactive Management App Project](https://github.com/VERSO-UVM/Interactive-Management-App), a project that started from an established (see: [very](https://www.doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.1974.4309336) [old](https://www.doi.org/10.1109/PROC.1975.9765) but still [widely](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11205-014-0764-x) [used](https://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/UTIRDF3JWTXB5IJWESYX/full)) research method. Most research advances carry a degree of risk, of course. Yep, some will fail, and we're okay with that, because if even a few methods for solving hard problems succeed, we can make a significant difference in the lives of people.

Once we've found a promising research artifact (like a new method or tool), we "intentionally shepherd" its progress toward "greater accessibility." To really make any research product open, we can't just expect something to go viral because it exists somewhere in some form on the internet. Artifacts only become [truly open](https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/4466) when we (a) _create information_, (b) _share information_, and (c) _make information accessible_ about our artifacts. Given how difficult each step is alone, ORCA does not assume that a researcher can slap a little documentation on their tool at the end and call it good. Instead, it helps to [design for accessibility](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Just_Ask/hRnpXbFB06cC) by working closely with stakeholders from the start. That way, we know what information stakeholders (multiple!!) value, how best to communicate that information to diverse audiences, and how to integrate it into the final product. To us, this is intentional shepherding toward accessibility.

Fortunately, we don't have to create a new process for doing this every time: here's where open source comes back in! With resources for [getting started](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-practical-guide-to-start-opensource-contributions/), resources covering [things it would've been nice had they taught in most schools](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/), and home-grown resources for real roles like [employees](ORCA_Handbook.md) and [team leads](Onboarding.md), ORCA makes use of open source design and programming practices to make research artifacts accessible. More on this coming up next.

## We train tomorrow's workforce through open source

[Start here]

ORCA internships create learning environments that provide every student with the best opportunities to construct their own knowledge and acquire practical skills relevant to their interests. It achieves these outcomes by incorporating research-based principles of learning (e.g. forming connections through practical examples, fostering feelings of belonging) that create inclusive climates for students of diverse backgrounds and through frequent, immediate, clear, and kind feedback. 

the development team is building a web app that walk groups through a problem-solving method. Researchers and community members alike will be able to use the app to solve problems together. In particular, the app benefits from open sourcing because researchers, practitioners, and really any interested community member can dig into the documentation, figure out what the tool is doing, whether it's right for their application, and even modify a copy to their liking!

### Internship learning objectives/outcomes
This internship will advance students toward being able to do the following:
- Collaborate with other professionals to address customer and stakeholder needs.
- Execute industry-standard Agile software development activities.
- Communicate the professional activities you know how to perform.

### Use of required platforms and software:
GitHub will be used as a code repo, project management tool and knowledge repository for both the specific project and overall ORCA Program. MS Teams will be used as the virtual meeting software and Sprint Review will be recorded. The ORCA Slack will be used for team communication and document storage
