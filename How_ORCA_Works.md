## Summary
ORCA's goals are to (1) produce impactful, accessible open source research tools by (2) training tomorrow's workforce in marketable open source skills. This page describes how we at ORCA achieve these two goals. In short, by drawing on the latest research on openness, we work with stakeholders to design research products that are open to more people from more backgrounds while creating environments in which students are more likely to learn valued workplace skills.

## What's the need?
Here at [VERSO](https://verso.w3.uvm.edu/), we focus on open source in all its incarnations. But, while to some see open source as an end in and of itself, we primarily view open source as a means for addressing crucial problems related to greater [transparency](https://www.archives.gov/files/cui/documents/2009-WH-memo-on-transparency-and-open-government.pdf), [innovation](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/ostp_public_access_memo_2013.pdf), and [inclusion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/08-2022-OSTP-Public-Access-Memo.pdf).

It is in this light that funders turn to open source to address increasing concerns that research and its products aren't getting into the hands of those who need it most. For example, the US National Science Foundation created the [Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE)](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/pathways-enable-open-source-ecosystems-pose) program to "ensure broader and more diverse adoption of open-source products...and a more focused route to technologies with broad societal impact." Likewise, the Sloan Foundation's [Better Software for Science](https://sloan.org/programs/digital-technology/better-software-for-science) program funds open source because "academia often fails to leverage best practices for software engineering from industry or...to realize the full potential of software in advancing discovery."

Underlying these programs is a desire for greater [research translation](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/accelerating-research-translation-art) -- that is, making research sufficiently accessible and applicable to other contexts that people in other fields, companies, governments, etc. can effectively implement, mature, and scale up those research advances. Research often does not get translated into other fields or into practice for [several reasons](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/accelerating-research-translation-art/nsf23-558/solicitation#pgm_intr_txt): a university may lack financial resources, lack local innovation ecosystems, or may incentivize fundamental (i.e. theoretical) research significantly more than applied research. Insufficient translation means that taxpayer funds often do not benefit taxpayers, feasible solutions don't get implemented in practice, and important issues go unexplored altogether. Consequently, significant need exists for greater research translation and the knowledge of how to translate research.

This lack of translation intersects with something else we seen in industry and academia: students often emerge from college without needed ("real") workplace skills. Insufficient programming skills manifest as [shortages of programmers](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/09/21/1079695/new-approaches-to-the-tech-talent-shortage/) which, in turn, makes it harder for companies to adopt the latest technologies. On the other hand, [engineering graduates often lack "professional skills,"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2005.tb00828.x) like communication and teamwork skills. This has been so much the case that it eventually motivated the engineering accreditation body ABET to require universities to teach engineering students these skill in order to receive accreditation. Governments are concerned here, too, with even [militaries providing significant funding for education](https://www.grants.gov/search-results-detail/351854) and outreach activities.

This isn't a new phenomenon, though; for centuries (literally), students have learned how to become valued contributors to an occupation [on the job](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Situated_Learning/CAVIOrW3vYAC) rather than in school. Indeed, [this still happens today in open source software](https://doi.org/10.2753/MIS0742-1222250401). This and other examples have led engineering educators and others to turn to [project-based learning](https://knilt.arcc.albany.edu/images/4/4d/PBL_Article.pdf) in which students kinda-sorta "learn on the job" while being in the classroom. Often, these students work on real projects under the tutelage of instructors, mentors, and even [recent students](doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2020.14214). Indeed, a growing body of work demonstrates that giving students legitimate (i.e. _real_) tasks to work on, ones that affect other people and that could actually go into practice, can spur student learning toward becoming valued members of an occupation and is often more mearningful for students. While not the only way to learn, researchers generally agree that [students need work grounded in reality](doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2020.14214) to learn an occupation. So is there a way we can train students in what they'll _need_ to do in the workforce -- legitimate work, work that makes an impact -- while they're still in school?

Good news: _work that makes an impact_ sounds a lot like translation work, doesn't it?

## We translate research by "opening up" research
VERSO addresses the need for research translation by intentionally shepherding projects with high-impact potential toward greater accessibility through open source practices.

## We train tomorrow's workforce through open source
ORCA internships create learning environments that provide every student with the best opportunities to construct their own knowledge and acquire practical skills relevant to their interests. It achieves these outcomes by incorporating research-based principles of learning (e.g. forming connections through practical examples, fostering feelings of belonging) that create inclusive climates for students of diverse backgrounds and through frequent, immediate, clear, and kind feedback. 

### Internship learning objectives/outcomes
This internship will advance students toward being able to do the following:
- Collaborate with other professionals to address customer and stakeholder needs.
- Execute industry-standard Agile software development activities.
- Communicate the professional activities you know how to perform.

### Use of required platforms and software:
GitHub will be used as a code repo, project management tool and knowledge repository for both the specific project and overall ORCA Program. MS Teams will be used as the virtual meeting software and Sprint Review will be recorded. The ORCA Slack will be used for team communication and document storage

## Who We Are
ORCA's daily operations are run by Kendall Fortney, Director of VERSO, an experienced industry designer and program manager. Kendall receives strategy and community assistance from John Meluso, VERSO Postdoctoral Fellow, an expert in management and organizing in open ecosystems. Kendall and John design and operate ORCA with consultation from an advisory committee of teaching and research professors across the fields of computer science and business.
