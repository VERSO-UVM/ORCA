## Summary
ORCA's goals are to (1) produce impactful, accessible open source research tools by (2) training tomorrow's workforce in marketable open source skills. This page describes how we at ORCA achieve these two goals. In short, by drawing on the latest research on openness, we work with stakeholders to design research products that are open to more people from more backgrounds while creating environments in which students are more likely to learn valued workplace skills.

## What's the need?
Funders express increasing concern that research and its products aren't getting into the hands of those who need it most. For example, the US National Science Foundation created the [Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE)](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/pathways-enable-open-source-ecosystems-pose) program to "ensure a broader and more diverse adoption of open-source products...and a more focused route to technologies with broad societal impact." Likewise, NSF's [Accelerating Research Translation (ART)](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/accelerating-research-translation-art) program builds university capacity to "translate" research -- that is, make research sufficiently accessible and applicable to other contexts that researchers in other fields, companies, governments, etc. can effectively implement, mature, and scale up those research advances. ART [notes](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/accelerating-research-translation-art/nsf23-558/solicitation#pgm_intr_txt) that research may not be translated into practice for several reasons: a university may lack financial resources, lack local innovation ecosystems, or may incentivize fundamental (i.e. theoretical) research significantly more than its application. These calls reflect a growing problem: insufficient translation means that taxpayer funds often do not benefit taxpayers, feasible solutions don't get implemented in practice, and important issues go unexplored altogether. Consequently, significant need exists for greater research translation and the knowledge of how to translate research.

Here at [VERSO](https://verso.w3.uvm.edu/), this intersected something we've seen in industry and academia: students often emerge from college without the necessary skills. This manifests as [shortages of developers](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/09/21/1079695/new-approaches-to-the-tech-talent-shortage/) which, in turn, makes it harder for companies to adopt the latest technologies. On the other hand, [engineering graduates often lack "professional skills,"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2005.tb00828.x) like communication and teamwork skills, motivating the engineering accreditation body ABET to add these skills to their accreditation requirements for students. [This isn't a new phenomenon](doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2020.14214), though; for centuries (literally), students have learned how to become valued contributors to an occupation _on the job_. Seeing this, engineering education researchers and others have turned to [project-based learning](https://knilt.arcc.albany.edu/images/4/4d/PBL_Article.pdf) in which students kinda-sorta "learn on the job" while being in the classroom in some cases, but often work on real projects under the tutelage of instructors, mentors, and even [other students](doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2020.14214). A growing body of work demonstrates that giving students legitimate (i.e. _real_) tasks to work on, ones that affect other people and that could actually go into practice, can spur student learning toward becoming valued members of an occupation and is often more mearningful for students. So is there a way we can train students in what they'll _need_ to do in the workforce -- legitimate work, work that makes an impact, while they're still in school?

Fortunately, _work that makes an impact_ sounds a lot like translation work doesn't it? [start here!]

## How we open up research
- VERSO addresses this by making research with high impact potential more accessible from the start

## How we train students in and through open source
ORCA internships create learning environments that provide every student with the best opportunities to construct their own knowledge and acquire practical skills relevant to their interests. It achieves these outcomes by incorporating research-based principles of learning (e.g. forming connections through practical examples, fostering feelings of belonging) that create inclusive climates for students of diverse backgrounds and through frequent, immediate, clear, and kind feedback. 

### Internship learning objectives/outcomes
This internship will advance students toward being able to do the following:
- Collaborate with other professionals to address customer and stakeholder needs.
- Execute industry-standard Agile software development activities.
- Communicate the professional activities you know how to perform.

### Use of required platforms and software:
GitHub will be used as a code repo, project management tool and knowledge repository for both the specific project and overall ORCA Program. MS Teams will be used as the virtual meeting software and Sprint Review will be recorded. The ORCA Slack will be used for team communication and document storage

## Who We Are
ORCA's daily operations are run by Kendall Fortney, Director of VERSO, an experienced industry designer and program manager. Kendall receives strategy and community assistance from John Meluso, VERSO Postdoctoral Fellow, an expert in management and organizing in open ecosystems. Kendall and John design and operate ORCA with consultation from an advisory committee of teaching and research professors across the fields of computer science and business.
