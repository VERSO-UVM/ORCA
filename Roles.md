# Roles

Roles are responsive to project needs, and students may change or switch roles during their time in ORCA. There are several standard roles that will remain over times. 

## Team Lead

### Summary
The ORCA Team Lead intern will contribute to the design, development, and maintenance of open-source software projects that support research, community impact, and innovation. As a Team Lead, this role also carries responsibility for guiding a small team of interns, coordinating with project sponsors, and ensuring the successful execution of open-source development projects. The Team Lead serves as both a mentor and a collaborator, bridging technical expertise with community engagement.

### Key Responsibilities

* Lead a team of ORCA participants, providing technical guidance, mentorship, and support throughout the project lifecycle.
* Work directly with project sponsors to define goals, refine requirements, and communicate progress.
* Conduct research to identify relevant technologies, frameworks, and best practices for project success.
* Oversee and contribute to the development of open-source software using standard engineering methodologies.
* Engage with researchers, community members, and open-source contributors to foster collaboration and gather feedback.
* Identify and connect with relevant research and open-source partners to strengthen project outcomes.
* Create and execute open-source project plans, including technical documentation and outreach materials.
* Participate in development activities that help translate UVM research into community impact and promote open-source contributions.

### Qualifications
The ideal candidate for the ORCA Software Developer Team Lead position will be a current undergraduate or graduate student at the University of Vermont with an interest in applying technology for research and community impact. Candidates should demonstrate proficiency in one or more programming languages, such as Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, or Ruby, and be comfortable working with version control systems like GitHub or GitLab. A solid understanding of software engineering practices—including coding, debugging, testing, and documentation—is essential. Equally important are strong leadership and communication skills, with the ability to mentor peers, coordinate teamwork, and collaborate effectively with researchers, community partners, and open-source contributors. Successful applicants will bring strong analytical and problem-solving abilities, an enthusiasm for open-source development, and the organizational skills needed to balance multiple priorities and meet project milestones.

### Desirable Skills
Beyond the core qualifications, candidates with experience leading teams or managing projects will be well-prepared for this role. Familiarity with Agile or other collaborative development methodologies is a plus, as is prior participation in open-source projects or contributions to online code repositories. Skills in web development, data visualization, or working with emerging technologies can provide additional value to project outcomes. An interest in community engagement and the ability to translate complex technical concepts for non-technical audiences are especially valuable, since much of the work connects research to real-world applications.
