# ORCA (Open Research Community Accelerator)

[VERSO page](https://verso.w3.uvm.edu/orca/)
## Summary
Open Research Community Accelerator is a new initiative that aims to translate academic research into open projects with social impact using project teams. It is focused on a dynamic and passionate group of undergraduate and master's students dedicated to bridging the gap between cutting-edge university research and real-world impact. Comprising 4-5 members, each bringing their unique skills and perspectives, the team collaborates closely with professors, researchers, and community experts to identify research with the potential for broader application and transforming these research findings into open projects.

ORCA also offers faculty, graduate students and community organizations with product and development support to enhance the public value of their research and address collective community needs. The program operates under the supervision of the Director of VERSO, who also provides mentorship and guidance to the students.

The program will provide UVM students, regardless of college or major, with innovative experiential learning opportunities to become the next generation of leaders. Second, it simultaneously provides faculty, graduate students and community organizations with product and development support to further the public impact of discoveries created in UVMâ€™s research endeavors and supports solving collective community needs.

## Projects
### Interactive Management App
The Interactive Management App project will design and build an open source tool for conducting Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) research with participants. The Interactive Management App will produce a flow diagram that helps a group of people solve a collective problem. The app will take in a list of factors identified by research participants that affect a specific problem. It will then work with participants to figure out the relationships between factors (things that impact their ability to act). An algorithm will then determine which factors should be addressed first, second, and so on in order for the group to meet their goals. This tool will be used in Thriving in Open Source Communities in Africa. See more in the Githuib for ISM
