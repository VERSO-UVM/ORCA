## (Open Research Community Accelerator)
The [Open Research Community Accelerator (ORCA)](https://verso.w3.uvm.edu/orca/) is a initiative that aims to translate academic research into open projects with social impact. It is focused on a dynamic and passionate groups of students dedicated to bridging the gap between cutting-edge university research and real-world impact through open source work. This program is run and funded by the University of Vermont [Open Source Program Office (VERSO)](https://verso.w3.uvm.edu).

This Repository contains all the supporting documentation and policies for the ORCA program. These documents are meant to help new ORCA members learns the program, show project sponsors how we work, and provide a template that can be "forked" to other academic institutions.

Best experience is through Github Pages here: [https://verso-uvm.github.io/ORCA/](https://verso-uvm.github.io/ORCA/)

## The Handbook
The best place to start is the [ORCA Handbook](ORCA_Handbook.md)! This contains an ORCA overview, Employment Policies, UVM Policies, Communication and Marketing, Health and Safety Policies and Resources

## Recruiting and Onboarding
We have tried to lay out some of the materials for hiring students including the job descriptions in [Recruiting](/Recruiting.md)] and we hope to expand this with much more information about how we find and bring new students into ORCA. We also have built onboarding processes but these are still evolving:
* [Onboarding for a Team Lead](Onboarding.md#team-lead-onboarding)
* [Onboarding for a Team Member](Onboarding.md#team-member-onboarding)

## Policies and Plans
There are several stand alone policies that are uniquely applicable to the ORCA Program. These include:
* [Emergency Preparedness Plan](Emergency_Preparedness_Plan.md)
* [Confidentiality and Data Security Policies](Confidentiality_and_Data_Security_Policies.md)
* [IT and Data Security Policies](IT_and_Data_Security_Policies.md)
* [Intellectual Property Policy](Intellectual_Property_Policy.md)
* [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

These policies apply to anyone working on an ORCA project, be it paid, for class credit or as a student club volunteer.
