## Summary
The [Open Research Community Accelerator](https://verso.w3.uvm.edu/orca/) is a new initiative that aims to translate academic research into open projects with social impact using project teams. It is focused on a dynamic and passionate group of undergraduate and master's students dedicated to bridging the gap between cutting-edge university research and real-world impact. Comprising 4-5 members, each bringing their unique skills and perspectives, the team collaborates closely with professors, researchers, and community experts to support research with the potential for broader application and transforming these research findings into open source projects.

The program will provide UVM students, regardless of college or major, with innovative experiential learning opportunities to become the next generation of leaders. It will also provide faculty, graduate students and community organizations with product and development support to further the public impact of discoveries created in UVMâ€™s research endeavors.

This program is run and funded by the University of Vermont [Open Source Program Office (VERSO)](https://verso.w3.uvm.edu).

## Pod
Each group of students is called a Pod. Pods follow a shared structure and policies which are in this section

## Projects
The Fall 2023 currently has one project for [Pod #1](https://verso.w3.uvm.edu/orca-pod/) which is working on the following project:
### Interactive Management App
The Interactive Management App project will design and build an open source tool for conducting Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) research with participants. The Interactive Management App will produce a flow diagram that helps a group of people solve a collective problem. The app will take in a list of factors identified by research participants that affect a specific problem. It will then work with participants to figure out the relationships between factors (things that impact their ability to act). An algorithm will then determine which factors should be addressed first, second, and so on in order for the group to meet their goals. This tool will be used in Thriving in Open Source Communities in Africa. See more in the Githuib for ISM
