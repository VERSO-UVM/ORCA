## Summary
The [Open Research Community Accelerator](https://verso.w3.uvm.edu/orca/) is a new initiative that aims to translate academic research into open projects with social impact using project teams. It is focused on a dynamic and passionate group of undergraduate and master's students dedicated to bridging the gap between cutting-edge university research and real-world impact. Comprising 4-5 members, each bringing their unique skills and perspectives, the team collaborates closely with professors, researchers, and community experts to support research with the potential for broader application and transforming these research findings into open source projects.

The program will provide UVM students, regardless of college or major, with innovative experiential learning opportunities to become the next generation of leaders. It will also provide faculty, graduate students and community organizations with product and development support to further the public impact of discoveries created in UVMâ€™s research endeavors.

This program is run and funded by the University of Vermont [Open Source Program Office (VERSO)](https://verso.w3.uvm.edu).
