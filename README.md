## Summary
The [Open Research Community Accelerator](https://verso.w3.uvm.edu/orca/) is an initiative that grows the impact of academic research by making research products accessible to other academics, local businesses, and community members through _open source practices_. ORCA creates these products through student project teams called _**Pods**_ -- groups of dynamic and passionate students who learn industry open source practices by working on _real_ products destined for public use. Each ORCA Pod consists of 4-5 student interns, each of whom brings unique skills and perspectives to their team. Pods collaborate closely with professors, researchers, and community experts to ensure product quality and high-quality education. Altogether, the program achieves two important goals:

  _**ORCA produces impactful, accessible open source research tools by training tomorrow's workforce in marketable open source skills**_.

For **UVM faculty, graduate students, and local businesses**, the ORCA program provides _affordable product and development support_ that advances your discoveries and innovations while _broadening your public impact_.

For **UVM students**, regardless of college or major, the ORCA program provides experiential learning opportunities through working on cutting-edge university research and industry advances. You will _learn how to navigate new situations_, thereby equipping you to become the next generation of technology and innovation leaders.

This program is run the University of Vermont [Open Source Program Office (VERSO)](https://verso.w3.uvm.edu).
