## Summary
The [Open Research Community Accelerator](https://verso.w3.uvm.edu/orca/) is an initiative by the [Vermont Research Open Source Program Office (VERSO)](https://verso.w3.uvm.edu/). ORCA expands the impact of research by making academic research products accessible to other academics, local businesses, and community members through _open source practices_. ORCA creates these products through student project teams called _**Pods**_ -- groups of dynamic and passionate students who learn industry open source practices through working on _real_ products destined for public use. Each ORCA Pod consists of 4-5 student interns. Each intern brings valuable skills and perspectives to their team. Pods collaborate closely with professors, researchers, and community experts to ensure product quality and high-quality education. Altogether, the ORCA program achieves two important goals: it trains tomorrow's workforce in desirable open source skills by producing impactful, accessible open source research tools.

For **UVM faculty, graduate students, and local businesses**, the ORCA program provides affordable product and development support that advances your discoveries and innovations while furthering UVM's public impact.

For **UVM students**, regardless of college or major, the ORCA program creates experiential learning opportunities through working on cutting-edge university research and industry advances. These experiences will equip you to become the next generation of technology and innovation leaders.
