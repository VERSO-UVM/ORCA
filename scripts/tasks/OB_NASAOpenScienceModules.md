[Transform to Open Science (TOPS)](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/) is part of NASA’s [Open-Source Science Initiative](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/open-science/) which is making a long-term commitment to create a scientific culture that is ready for 21st century challenges. To support everyone’s path to a more open and equitable scientific future, TOPS has created an Open Science 101 (OS101) curriculum. The curriculum aims to introduce learners to a nuanced understanding of open science, enabling participants to actively participate in open science. The five modules introduce participants to the definitions, tools, and resources available to share their research process and products more openly.

The curriculum is available on the [NASA TOPS Github site](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/) and can be taken as a massive open online course (MOOC) here. NASA TOPS Open Science 101 was developed by the global open science community to help everyone learn the key practical skills and useful tools that help us all work openly together. The curriculum is designed to be completed either independently, through a MOOC or in a group, at in-person or online workshops. The NASA TOPS site has more information about other modes for taking the curriculum. The time commitment to complete all five modules is about 3 - 12 hours, depending on your knowledge of open science.
