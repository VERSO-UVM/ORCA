## Emergency Preparedness

We have an emergency preparedness plan in place to address various scenarios, including cybersecurity, fires, medical emergencies, and natural disasters. Team members should familiarize themselves with this plan and know their roles and responsibilities. 

Emergency contact information for team leaders, campus security, and local emergency services will be readily available to all team members. In the event of an emergency, follow the appropriate procedures and contact the necessary authorities.

# Emergency Preparedness Plan

## Introduction

The emergency preparedness plan outlines procedures and protocols to be followed in the event of emergencies or unforeseen incidents that may impact ORCA and its contributors. The primary goal of this plan is to ensure the safety and well-being of project participants and to minimize disruptions to project operations, recognizing that the team operates remotely.

## Emergency Response Team

- **Designated Personnel**: The emergency response team consists of designated individuals responsible for coordinating emergency response efforts and ensuring the safety of project contributors, even in remote settings.
- **Contact Information**: Contact information for emergency response team members, including phone numbers and email addresses, will be maintained and readily accessible to lead.

## Emergency Scenarios and Procedures
The University has developed various levels of emergency to assist with conveying the complexity or severity of the disaster. These incident types are aligned with the National Incident Management
System with Type 1 being most complex or severe and Type 5 being the lease complex or severe. For more information look [here](https://www.uvm.edu/sites/default/files/2016%20UVM%20Emergency%20Operations%20Plan.pdf).

* TYPE 1 - A catastrophic emergency event involving the entire campus and surrounding community. Immediate resolution of the disaster, which is usually multi-hazard, is beyond the emergency response
capabilities of campus and local resources (Example: earthquake, major hurricane, or act of terrorismwhich would require State and Federal assistance.)
* TYPE 2 - A major emergency that impacts a sizable portion of the campus and/or outside community. Type 2 emergencies may be single or multi-hazard situations, and often require considerable and timely
coordination both within and outside the University. Type 2 emergencies also include imminent events on campus or in the general community that may develop into a major University crisis or a full disaster
(Examples: active shooter, bomb threat, heating plant failure, extended power outage, severe storms, major fire, domestic water contamination or a major contagious disease pandemic).
* TYPE 3 - Type 3 situations may emerge as a single incident, but have the potential to quickly evolve into a multi-faceted campus crisis. Examples of a type 3 incident would be a large fire contained to a single
building or complex. The incident would stretch campus resources but itâ€™s impact across the campus will be limited. 
* TYPE 4 - A department or building incident that can be resolved with existing University resources or limited outside help. A Type 2 incident is usually a one dimensional event that has a limited duration and
little impact to the campus community beyond those using the space/building in which it occurred (Example: Minor chemical or fuel oil spills, broken pipe with some flooding, or a minor fire confined to a
room and not involving hazardous chemicals.). 
* TYPE 5 - A minor department or building incident that can be resolved by the responding service unit (Custodial Services, Physical Plant, Police Services, Risk Management, Telecommunications, etc). This
may result in calling in personnel and notifying the department where the problem occurred (Example: Physical Plant responds to a report of no heat in a building). 

### Fire

- **Evacuation Procedures**: In the event of a fire, project contributors should evacuate their immediate location and move to a safe area, such as outdoors or a designated meeting point, following local emergency guidelines.
- **Communication**: Utilize communication channels such as email, messaging platforms, or video conferencing to alert team members of the situation and ensure everyone has evacuated safely.

### Medical Emergencies

- **First Aid**: Encourage team members to keep a basic first aid kit at home. In the event of a medical emergency, call emergency services and provide first aid instructions as necessary until help arrives.
- **Communication**: Notify project leaders and team members of the medical emergency using communication channels and ensure that affected individuals receive necessary assistance and support.

### Natural Disasters

- **Severe Weather**: Follow local weather alerts and guidelines for severe weather events. Encourage team members to take shelter in a safe location and communicate their status to the rest of the team.
- **Earthquakes**: If an earthquake occurs, drop, cover, and hold on. After the shaking stops, assess for injuries and damage, and communicate with team members to ensure their safety.

### Cybersecurity Incidents

- **Data Breach Response**: In the event of a cybersecurity incident, project leaders will coordinate with IT security personnel to contain the breach and communicate with affected team members.
- **Communication**: Notify all team members of the incident and provide guidance on steps to take to secure their systems and data. Encourage transparency and prompt reporting of suspicious activities.

## Communication and Notification

- **Emergency Contacts**: Maintain a list of emergency contact information for local emergency services and project leaders. Ensure that all team members have access to this information.
- **Communication Channels**: Establish communication channels, such as email distribution lists or messaging platforms, for disseminating emergency notifications and updates to project contributors. Regularly test communication channels to ensure reliability.

## Training and Drills

- **Emergency Training**: Provide remote training sessions for project contributors on emergency procedures and protocols. Ensure that all contributors are familiar with evacuation procedures, first aid techniques, and other essential safety practices.
- **Emergency Drills**: Conduct regular remote emergency drills to practice response procedures and familiarize team members with emergency protocols. Evaluate drill performance and identify areas for improvement.

## Plan Review and Updates

- **Regular Review**: The emergency preparedness plan will be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect changes in project operations, personnel, or external factors that may impact emergency response procedures.
- **Feedback and Improvement**: Encourage feedback from team members on the effectiveness of emergency response procedures and protocols. Use feedback to make improvements and enhance overall emergency preparedness.

This emergency preparedness plan provides guidelines and procedures for responding to various emergency scenarios, considering the remote nature of the team. It's important for all team members to familiarize themselves with this plan and be prepared to respond effectively in emergency situations, even when working remotely.
