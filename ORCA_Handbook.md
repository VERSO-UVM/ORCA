## ORCA Overview
The [Open Research Community Accelerator](https://verso.w3.uvm.edu/orca/) run by [Vermont Research Open Source Program Office (VERSO)](https://verso.w3.uvm.edu)) at the Univerisity of Vermont, is dedicated to bridging the gap between academic research and real-world impact through open projects with social significance. Comprised of dynamic and passionate student teams, each consisting of 4-5 members, ORCA collaborates closely with professors, researchers, and community experts to identify research with broader application potential and translate these findings into open source projects.

This internship opportunity within ORCA offers UVM students a chance to gain hands-on experience in translating academic research into impactful open projects. It operates under Agile software development practices and fosters inclusive learning environments through platforms like GitHub, MS Teams, and Slack. Assessment is based on customer, stakeholder, and self-feedback, focusing on personal growth and professional development.

ORCA provides faculty, graduate students, and community organizations with product and development support to enhance the public value of their research and address collective community needs. Under the supervision of the Director of VERSO, who also offers mentorship and guidance, ORCA aims to empower the next generation of leaders while fostering innovation and social impact.

## Culture
ORCA is a place where we encourage creative leaps to solve problems that likely have never been solved before. In order to do that you must be empowered to take risks, try new things and be given the space to figure out roadblocks. By having a set of rule
Create Raving Fans
Be Curious, not Judgemental

## Organizational Structure
the VERSO Director is the supervisor for all students that are working on ORCA tasks either for a paid internship or for credit report. Questions about compensation, taking time off, disciplinary actions or other administrative tasks should go to them.

All leadership positions (with "lead" in the title) also will go to the VERSO Director for project assigment and tasks. Leads can work together to create tasks for each other as well.

The Team Leads 
## Pods
ORCA is built around the idea of Pods, or groups of students working together to solve problems. In real working environments, teamwork is a vital skill. We hope to grow ORCA members abilities to work together collaboratively and learn how to instinctively reach out to peers to troubleshoot problem and validate their work.

## Professionalism

- **Appropriate Dress and Language:**  Given that different environments will require different standards of dress, it is the responsibility of the supervisor to inform students what dress will be appropriate and inappropriate for their specific position.
- **Attitude:**  While at work, you should work with a cooperative and positive attitude.
- **Timeliness:**  It is essential that you report to work at the agreed upon time, ready to work. Notification of lateness or inability to work a scheduled shift should be given to supervisors by students at least 24 hours in advance. This allows supervisors to plan for a student’s absence. In the event of an emergency, the supervisor should be informed as soon as possible.
- **Use of Work Time:** Student employment at UVM is intended to allow students access to environments, projects, and tasks that will develop their professional and interpersonal skills. As such, it is not appropriate to complete school work during scheduled working hours. Supervisors
are expected to set explicit expectations on this matter.

### Performance evaluation process
While this internship takes place in an academic setting, we will not give you grades. Our goal is to equip you to perform professional activities like professionals perform those activities, and to be able to describe and demonstrate your ability to perform those activities.
Instead, assessments in this internship will come in the form of customer-, stakeholder-, and self-feedback. How well are your products meeting their needs? How well does the team communicate with customers and stakeholders about project progress and status? And how well do you think you are doing at advancing toward your own goals?
At the beginning of each semester we will ask you to state your goals for personal growth. At the end of each semester, we will ask you to reflect and assess your own advancement toward those goals. You will be required to submit these initial and final statements to help us understand your learning journey, and to improve your own learning journey and those of your peers, now and in the future.

## ORCA Policies

### Attendance policy and internship environment expectations: 
In this internship, we will work together to develop a learning community that is inclusive and respectful. As a learning community we will seek to encourage and appreciate expressions of different ideas, opinions, and beliefs in the spirit of Our Common Ground. Meaningful and constructive dialogue is encouraged in this internship. This requires mutual respect, willingness to listen, and open-mindedness to opposing points of view. Respect for individual differences and alternative viewpoints will be maintained at all times in this internship. Conduct that substantially or repeatedly disrupts the ability of instructors to teach and the ability of students to engage may result in my asking a student to temporarily leave the meeting.

The Code is designed to help you make ethical choices when and if you are faced with a difficult decision or situation. Everyone is expected to adhere to the highest standards of ethical behavior and conduct themselves in a professional manner at all times. This includes honesty, integrity, respect for others, and compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
The University of Vermont is committed to continually strengthening its ethical culture.

### Drug and alcohol policies
UVM receives federal grants and is therefore required to comply with the Alcohol and Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988. This Act requires that colleges receiving federal monies provide and maintain a drug-free workplace. UVM has no intention of intruding into the private lives of its student employees; however, the university does retain the right and responsibility to expect each employee to report to work and to perform their duties in a manner that will not jeopardize the health and safety of co-workers or other students. Some of the drugs that are illegal under state or federal law include marijuana, heroin, hashish, cocaine, hallucinogens and depressants and/or stimulants when not prescribed for medical care.

Any student employee who is at the workplace under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs, or who possesses or consumes alcohol or illegal drugs on the job or in the workplace, is subject to university disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal from the University. The illegal manufacture, distribution, or sale of illegal substances on the premises is strictly prohibited and will constitute an offense warranting dismissal. Any illegal substance found shall be turned over to an appropriate law enforcement agency. 

### FERPA Rights Disclosure: 
The purpose of UVM’s FERPA Rights Disclosure is to communicate the rights of students regarding access to, and privacy of their student educational records as provided for in the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974. 

***Religious Holidays**
Religions may be practiced in many different ways, and can impact participation in internships variably. Students have the right to practice the religion of their choice. Each semester students should submit in writing to their instructors as early as possible and at least one week prior to their documented religious holiday the date(s) of the conflict or absence. Instructors must permit students who miss work or exams for the purpose of religious observance to make up this work. The complete policy is [here](https://www.uvm.edu/registrar/religious-holidays).


## Communication and Marketing

### Social media and electronic communications policies
#### Authorized Use
Only authorized personnel designated by VERSO Director are permitted to manage official social media accounts and communication channels on behalf of the program. Social media and electronic communication channels should be used for professional purposes related to the program's activities, initiatives, and announcements.

#### Content Guidelines
- **Accurate Information**: Ensure all information shared on official social media accounts and communication channels is accurate, up-to-date, and aligned with the program's mission and values.
- **Respectful Language**: Use respectful and professional language in all communications. Avoid using offensive, discriminatory, or inflammatory language that could damage the program's reputation.
- **Confidentiality**: Do not share confidential or sensitive information about the program, its participants, or stakeholders on social media or electronic communication channels without proper authorization.

#### Privacy and Security

- **Protect Personal Information**: Respect the privacy of program participants, stakeholders, and employees. Do not share personal or sensitive information without consent.
- **Account Security**: Maintain strong passwords for all official social media accounts and communication channels. Enable two-factor authentication where available to enhance account security.

#### Endorsements and Disclaimers
- **Endorsements**: Clearly distinguish between personal opinions and official endorsements when posting on social media or electronic communication channels. Avoid endorsing products, services, or organizations without proper authorization from the VERSO Director.
- **Disclaimers**: Include disclaimers as necessary to clarify that opinions expressed on personal social media accounts do not represent the views of the program or organization.

The University has established a robust compliance reporting system made up of several reporting mechanisms. For more information on available reporting mechanisms, review the [Whistleblower Policy: Reporting, Protections, & Non-Retaliation policy](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.uvm.edu/sites/default/files/UVM-Policies/policies/whistleblower.pdf).

## Health and Safety Policies
Student employees are not eligible for benefits such as sick leave, overtime, holiday pay, vacation, or a retirement plan, but they are eligible for Worker’s Compensation under provisions of Vermont law. Worker’s Compensation covers expenses for medical care and certain benefits for loss of pay resulting from injuries or disabilities incurred while on the job. Supervisors should be contacted as soon as possiblein the event of any on-the-job injuries in order to allow for completion of the necessary forms. 
We strongly encourage a healthy work-life balance by setting reasonable expectations for workload and encouraging breaks and time off when needed. Burnout can negatively impact health and productivity, so it's important to prioritize self-care. 

Your academic needs are priority, if you need to work less due to classwork or test, let your project lead know and take care of what you need to do. 

At UVM we recognize that wellbeing looks different for everyone and that mental wellbeing is about much more than access to mental health care services. While CAPS plays an important role in supporting clinical mental health, there are many other resources on campus that also support student mental health and wellbeing. We encourage you to explore the wide variety of offerings available to support you and to help you support others.

Supporting someone in crisis
When helping someone in crisis or distress it can be hard to know what level of support they need. Take time to assess the situation by asking questions. Listening non-judgmentally and staying calm can assist you in getting to the most helpful response. Sometimes it requires calling 988 or 911. Sometimes all someone needs is someone to sit with while they are upset and to validate how they are feeling.
