# Introduction

Welcome to ORCA! We are excited to have you on board and we know that you will be a valuable contributor to our program.

As a team member, you will be responsible for working on an open source project with your peers. It is important that you manage your time well, achieve milestones and collaborate with others. Your commitments will include individual time, in person coworking time that advance the project and 1:1 your team leads for coaching on growth. Additionally there will be lunches and events you will be invited to, and the potential to travel to an event and present about the work. 

This onboarding document will provide you with the information you need to succeed in your role.

**Being Part of a Team
**
* **We are responsible for the choices we make:** A member of a team, we are responsible for our actions and accountable to the team, don’t be afraid of it and learn from your mistakes. This is a learning environment, mistakes are good!
* **We can only work together if we all know what we need to do:** A team member is able to communicate effectively with their other team members and their lead. This is hard, and requires practice and gathering feedback from everyone on how to be better.
* **Leadership happens at all levels:** Don’t be afraid to take the initiative on a problem, reach out to your lead and let them know and go for it.
* **Proactive understanding of problems:** A team member is able to identify and solve problems effectively before it gets too big. 
* **Work is a marathon, not a sprint:** Time management is important, if you wait until the last moment to complete the work there will be more mistakes and no time to correct them. This skill is vital for the rest of your life

# Your First Four Weeks

* Record your time to get paid every week
  
You will receive from your Lead the following meetings:

**This American Life - NUMMI
** Ira Glass, 
55 min 30 sec - 
Host Ira Glass introduces the story of the New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., aka NUMMI. In 1984, General Motors and Toyota opened NUMMI as a joint venture. Toyota showed GM the secrets of its production system: How it made cars of much higher quality and much lower cost than GM achieved. But today, GM cars still don't have the quality of Japanese imports. GM went bankrupt. And in 2010 NUMMI was closed, sending thousands of car workers looking for jobs. In this hour-long story, which we reported in 2010, NPR Automotive Correspondent Frank Langfitt tells the story of NUMMI and why GM—and the rest of the American car business—wasn't able to learn from it more quickly.

**Brene Brown on What Vulnerability Isn’t**
Worklife Podcast by Adam Grant,

We usually wear our thickest armor at work, and Brené Brown has blazed the trail of teaching us why and how to shed it. In this conversation, Adam and Brené unpack the power of showing vulnerability at work — and explore how much is too much. Learn when and where to set boundaries, find out how to get more comfortable with being uncomfortable, and hear Brené rethink a key assumption that she took for granted in her own work.
